# M83 – Midnight City

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
At night the city grows
Look at the horizon glow
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Drinking in the lounge
Following the neon signs
Waiting for a word
Looking at the milky skyline
The city is my church
It wraps me in its blinding twilight
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
