Ciggaretes and lonely nights
My stomach burns with butterflies
This emptyness fells like a midnight city sky
I just want to feel your skin
Trace every line and back again
And breath in your every breath just like it was my own

Whoaaaaaaaaaa
Im missing you tonight
And every second cuts just like a kife whoa whooooaaaaaaaaaa
Im missing you tonight

Ohhhhhhaaaa ohhhhhhaaaa

Ciggarettes and lonely nights
The smoke stings my sleepless eyes
I squint the world into a thousand blinding lights my shaking hands hold photographs
That bring so many memories back
They're torn and crinkled from all theses nights they had to last

Ohhhhhh whoaaaaaa
Im missing you tonight
And every second cuts just like a knife whoa
Whoooaaaaa
Im missing you tonight
Tell me what to do
Cause i just can't make it through
Another night without you here
When every seconds feels just like a year

Ohhhhhhhhhh

Is it fine to feel this way
Every hour in these days
Every minute every second
Every sunrise every sunset

Whoaaaaaa
Im missing you tonight
And every second cuts just like a knife
Whoooaaaaa
Im missing you tonight
Tell me what to
Cause i just can't make it through
Another night without you here
Every second feels just like a year
